        "Follow consistent naming conventions for tables, columns, indexes, and constraints to improve readability and maintainability.",
        "Use comments to document the purpose of tables, columns, and complex queries for better understanding by other developers.",
        "Prefer explicit joins (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) over implicit joins for clarity and to avoid accidental Cartesian products.",
