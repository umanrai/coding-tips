    "tips": [
        "Follow consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and scripts to improve readability and maintainability.",
        "Use comments to document the purpose, usage, and expected behavior of shell scripts and individual commands for better understanding by other developers.",
        "Prefer POSIX-compliant shell syntax for better portability across different Unix-like operating systems.",
        "Utilize shebang (#!) at the beginning of shell scripts to specify the interpreter (e.g., #!/bin/bash) and make scripts executable.",
        "Leverage environment variables for storing configuration values and avoiding hardcoding in shell scripts.",
        "Apply quoting to prevent word splitting and pathname expansion issues, especially when working with variables containing spaces or special characters.",
        "Use conditional constructs (e.g., if statements, case statements) for making decisions and controlling the flow of execution in shell scripts.",
        "Prefer shell built-in commands over external commands for improved performance and reduced overhead.",
        "Utilize functions to encapsulate reusable code blocks and improve modularity and maintainability of shell scripts.",
        "Apply error handling techniques (e.g., checking return codes, using && and || operators) to handle failures and unexpected conditions gracefully.",
        "Use traps to catch signals and perform cleanup tasks (e.g., removing temporary files) before exiting shell scripts.",
        "Prefer parameter expansion and command substitution over external commands (e.g., echo $var instead of echo $(command)) for better performance.",
        "Apply process substitution (e.g., <(command)) to treat the output of a command as a file, enabling seamless integration with other commands and utilities.",
        "Use redirection operators (e.g., >, >>, <) to control input and output streams and manipulate files in shell scripts.",
        "Prefer here documents (<<EOF) for multiline input to commands, especially when providing input to interactive programs within shell scripts.",
        "Apply arithmetic expansion (e.g., $((expression))) for performing arithmetic operations within shell scripts.",
        "Utilize arrays (e.g., array=(value1 value2 value3)) for storing and manipulating lists of values in shell scripts.",
        "Prefer the $(command) syntax over backticks (`command`) for command substitution, as it is more versatile and easier to read.",
        "Apply conditional expressions (e.g., [[ $var == value ]]) instead of single brackets for more robust and flexible conditional checks.",
        "Use the read command for reading input from users or files interactively within shell scripts, enabling user interaction.",
        "Prefer the printf command over echo for formatting output and displaying messages in shell scripts, as it provides more control and consistency.",
        "Apply globbing (e.g., *) for pattern matching and filename expansion in shell scripts, simplifying file operations and command-line tasks.",
        "Utilize the case statement for performing multiple conditional checks based on patterns or values in shell scripts, improving readability and maintainability.",
        "Prefer the && and || operators for chaining commands based on success or failure conditions, improving code readability and efficiency.",
        "Use the readonly keyword to declare variables as read-only to prevent accidental modification and enhance script safety.",
        "Apply command-line options (e.g., getopt, getopts) for parsing and handling command-line arguments in shell scripts, providing flexibility and customization.",
        "Prefer compound commands (e.g., { ... }) over subshells (e.g., (...) ) for grouping commands and controlling their execution within shell scripts.",
        "Utilize the test command (e.g., [ expression ] or [[ expression ]]) for performing various tests and checks within shell scripts, enabling conditional logic.",
        "Apply the IFS (Internal Field Separator) variable to control field splitting behavior when working with strings and input in shell scripts.",
        "Use the shell's built-in error handling mechanisms (e.g., set -e, set -u) to automatically exit on errors and unset variables, improving script robustness.",
        "Prefer the return statement for returning exit status codes from functions in shell scripts, enhancing readability and error handling.",
        "Apply the for loop (e.g., for var in list; do ...) for iterating over lists of values or files in shell scripts, enabling automation and repetitive tasks.",
        "Use the getopts built-in command for processing command-line options and flags in shell scripts with a standard and consistent approach.",
        "Prefer the case statement over multiple if-elif-else statements for handling multiple conditional branches in shell scripts, improving readability.",
        "Apply the shell's built-in string manipulation features (e.g., ${var#pattern}, ${var%%pattern}) for extracting substrings and performing text processing tasks.",
        "Use the basename and dirname commands for extracting the filename or directory name from a path in shell scripts, simplifying file operations.",
        "Prefer the exit command over directly setting the exit status to terminate shell scripts with a specific exit code, improving clarity and maintainability.",
        "Apply process substitution (e.g., <(command)) to treat the output of a command as a file, enabling seamless integration with other commands and utilities.",
