        "Follow Swift's naming conventions and guidelines for clarity and consistency in your codebase.",
        "Use descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and other entities to improve code readability.",
        "Leverage Swift's powerful features such as optionals, generics, closures, and protocols to write clean and expressive code.",
        "Apply access control modifiers (e.g., public, private, internal) to control the visibility and accessibility of your code.",
        "Prefer constants (let) over variables (var) whenever possible to ensure immutability and reduce mutability.",
        "Use guard statements to early exit from functions or methods when certain conditions are not met.",
        "Apply Swift's type inference feature to let the compiler infer the type of variables and constants wherever possible.",
        "Utilize Swift's optionals to represent values that may or may not exist, and handle nil values safely.",
        "Prefer struct over class for simple data structures and value types to take advantage of Swift's value semantics.",
        "Employ classes for more complex data models or when reference semantics are needed.",
        "Use enums to represent a group of related values and associated values for adding additional information to enum cases.",
        "Apply Swift's error handling mechanisms (do-try-catch) for handling and propagating errors in a structured way.",
        "Leverage Swift's Codable protocol for encoding and decoding data to and from JSON or other formats.",
        "Prefer protocol-oriented programming (POP) over inheritance to define behavior and promote code reuse.",
        "Use the defer statement to execute cleanup code regardless of whether an error occurred or not.",

        "Prefer value types (structs and enums) over reference types (classes) for better performance and thread safety.",

        "Employ guard let or if let to safely unwrap optionals and handle non-nil values.",
        "Prefer computed properties over stored properties for better control over the getter and setter logic.",
        "Apply default parameter values to provide sensible defaults for function parameters.",

        "Prefer struct over class when defining simple data models to take advantage of Swift's value semantics and avoid reference cycles.",
